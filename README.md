SPELLING MISTAKES
Somethimes they happen with regular english. This is not a reflection of itellegegence but simply a sign of self education. Plus these are notes that are able to be editied and changed. Anyone who thinks that things written are perfict hasn't seen an authors roughf drafts. These notes are ment to express my creative ablity and document the subject matter I'm learning. after all, while I do want to be a programmger, I want to code ultimatly for FUN. And every part of this process will be awsome in it's self; from these notes to the actualy projects I'm working on. I don;t see well written notes as taking away from me learning code but just making me better at typing, using my software stack, and being a computer guy. Plus potentioal employers can see my growth as I go along.

This is a file ment to take manual notes from freecodecamp.com. This is considered a review of materials as of this update to javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures section 50
Okay, so I'm at section 50 of free code camp, dealining with functions. I also learnsed how to commit changes to the README.md, which I sadily lost most of my notes on. This is a way to track the progress I'm making as I look for housing. You could say I'm the "Unhoused" developer, which is ironic in one of the most populos cities in the nation. No politic baised rants here, just noting the irony while I type this at a short term crisis center and wait for shelter at A street in hayward.

Okay, so for now thats all I got. You all shall see my work in the other files in this folder.
